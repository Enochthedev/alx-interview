# Minimum Operations to Obtain "n" 'H' Characters

This is a Python script that provides a function to calculate the minimum number of operations required to obtain exactly "n" occurrences of the character 'H' through a specific set of operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Save the provided Python script to a file named `minimum_operations.py`.

2. You can use the `minOperations` function by importing it into your Python code. To do this, follow these steps:

   ```python
   from minimum_operations import minOperations

   n = 9  # Replace 9 with the desired number of 'H' characters
   operations = minOperations(n)
   print(operations)
   ```

   Replace `n` with the desired number of 'H' characters you want to obtain. The function will return the minimum number of operations required to achieve that goal.

3. Run your Python script, and it will display the result of the minimum operations needed.

## Example

Let's demonstrate how to use the `minOperations` function with an example.

```python
from minimum_operations import minOperations

n = 9
operations = minOperations(n)
print(operations)
```

Output:

```
6
```

The output represents that it takes 6 operations to obtain exactly 9 occurrences of the character 'H' following the given operations.

Enjoy calculating the minimum operations using this Python script!

## Note

This script calculates the minimum number of operations needed to obtain a specific number of occurrences of the character 'H' by following a given set of operations. Adjust the value of `n` to calculate the minimum operations required for different scenarios.
